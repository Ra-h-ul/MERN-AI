We are making a chatgpt clone ai using mern.
for this we need to hve 5 pages 


Now inside src folder named routes and inside this route make folders for those five pages , which are :

1.chatpage
2.dashboardpage
3.homepage
4.sign in oage
5.sign out page

//To navigate between the pages we need the routing library and for this project i used react router dom.
install it .
do some required changes in main.jsx
create a router in main.jsx


//import homepage and all the pages.
now dashboard consists of two pages , so we made children , provided it a path of chatpage.
//we had an error as our element was out out our children 
so after including element of dashboard in our children we got it right.
